# YouTube Subscriptions Filter

A Chrome extension that makes YouTube less distracting by keeping you on your subscriptions feed, hiding Shorts, and letting you block specific channels.

## What it does

- **Redirects YouTube homepage** — Visiting `youtube.com` automatically takes you to your Subscriptions feed instead of the algorithmic home page
- **Hides Shorts** — The Shorts shelf is removed from your Subscriptions feed
- **Channel filtering** — Add channel names to a blocklist via the extension popup; their videos are hidden from your feed in real time
